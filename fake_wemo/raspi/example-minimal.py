""" fauxmo_minimal.py - Fabricate.IO

    This is a demo python file showing what can be done with the debounce_handler.
    The handler prints True when you say "Alexa, device on" and False when you say
    "Alexa, device off".

    If you have two or more Echos, it only handles the one that hears you more clearly.
    You can have an Echo per room and not worry about your handlers triggering for
    those other rooms.

    The IP of the triggering Echo is also passed into the act() function, so you can
    do different things based on which Echo triggered the handler.
